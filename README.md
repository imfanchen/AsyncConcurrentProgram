AsyncConcurrentProgram

During recent code review with a junior developer, 
I find a bug related to running multiple asynchronous task concurrently.
I looked up the official documentations on these topic.
Although the documentation's descriptions are very good, the code examples are very basic.
It only shows what to do but not what not to do.
On a quick glance, it's often that junior developer might miss the fine grained details.
This sample project is a quick demonstrations on how to write asynchronous concurrent programming correctly
and what to avoid when you are trying to do so.
